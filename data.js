        lyric: `I'm lonely
                I don't wanna drink again
                Rather lay myself with my old friend
                Oh Beryl, how does it end?
                Now that I'm alone again

                I'm lonely
                I still think of her sometimes
                Funny how she went inside my head
                Well it was four years ago
                Shouldn't I have moved on?

                Now that I have lost my senses
                I'm trying to hold on
                I wanna learn on how to love again
                Every now and then I try
                Though I can't seem to understand

                So if you have the time
                Could you teach me again?

                Ooh hope you have a lovely Sunday noon
                Hope I could say hi and see you soon
                Oh Tavoryn I'm really missing you
                Didn't mean to hurt you
                Which I did
                I understand now

                With all the mess I made
                I don't belong to someone like you

                Now that I have lost my senses
                I'm trying to hold on
                I wanna learn on how to love again
                Every distant memories
                I fully understand

                So if you have the time
                For my final goodbye

                Ooh hope you have a lovely Sunday noon
                Hope I could say hi and see you soon
                Oh Tavoryn I'm really missing you
                Didn't mean to hurt you
                Which I did
                I understand now

                With all the mess I made
                I don't belong to someone like you

                Thank you for the two years spent with you
                Now I know the things I shouldn't do
                Oh Tavoryn I'm grateful over you
                Didn't mean to hurt you
                Which I did
                I'm really sorry

                With all the mess I made
                I don't deserve the blessing you gave

                With all the mess I made
                I don't belong to someone like you`
